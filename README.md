# AST4320

This repository contains source codes, data files, and plots for the numerical project in AST4320.

- calculations_unit.py contains the calculations done to find the cone unit for mass
- calculations.py contains calculations for verifying the minimum halo the simulation could resolve
- Plotting.py contains the file used to produce all the plots in the report
- The rest of the files are data files gathered during the simulation. I have sorted my own according to approximate redshift in their own files, i.e. AHF_z0 etc, for easier plotting.
- The comparison data files are in the Comparison folder
- redshifts.txt is just a text file I used when attempting to find the dat files containing for the correct redshifts
